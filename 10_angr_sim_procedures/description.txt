You curse under your breadth. It's much past midnight. Enough that, while the
sun is still not visible, it's lighter outside than it was an hour ago.

It's a Saturday, no one will show up. You have time.

The binary you had found an hour ago was outdated. It hadn't been removed from
the server, possibly because a sysadmin overlooked it when updating the produc-
tion server. More likely, they just didn't care enough to bother removing it. It
didn't harm anything. And clearly, it didn't help you gain any more access to
their server; the backdoor simply didn't work on the running service.

It isn't worth getting upset over. Time to try a different set of binaries. You
find a few that might work. They are fairly similar to the previous one. This
time, however, there are so many calls to scanf that you wouldn't think of man-
ually hooking each one. Perhaps you could hook the scanf function itself; ins-
tead of hooking the address where it is called, you hook the address in the PLT
table that jumps to the shared library where scanf is defined.
