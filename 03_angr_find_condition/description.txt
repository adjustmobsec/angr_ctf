-- Did it work?

It's 8am. You glance back at Jeff. There isn't enough caffeine flowing through
your brain to understand his gibberish.

-- Did what work?

-- The 'avoid' parameter to the 'explore' function...

-- Oh! Yeah, it worked. Thanks.

He smiled, nodded, and walked off, probably to get a Red Bull from the vending
machine.

Another email.

- Hello,
-
- Good news! The passwords you found worked perfectly. In fact, with them, we
- could get full access to their system, including all of their plans for the
- new platform they plan to release, which would give us a huge leg up from a
- competitive standpoint.
-
- Bad news: Someone seems to have leaked that information to Eve Elle Software.
- We are still trying to figure out who the spy could possibly be. Legal is pre-
- paring for the worse, in case Eve Elle Software wants to try and sue us. Eve
- Elle also pushed changes to their software, adding an even more sophisticated
- backdoor. My source tells me that in this version, the location of the code
- that invokes the backdoor changes with every binary.
-
- Could you figure out a way to break it? I need it as soon as possible.
-
- As usual, thanks.
- Kelly
- Security Team Manager
- Skynet Software

-- Jeff!

At this point, you're considering asking to trade cubicles with Sam. She works
directly across from Jeff, so there would no longer be a physical barrier bet-
ween you and him.

-- Sorry, I'm busy at the moment. Can it wait 'till tomorrow?

No, it can't, but you don't tell him that.
