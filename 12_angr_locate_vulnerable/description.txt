It's past 6am at this point. You've been here all night.

You hear the sound of a door opening and closing.

Footsteps.

You frantically close all of the windows on Jeff's computer, turn off the moni-
tor, and stand up to meet whoever has arrived.

It's Jeff.

-- What are you doing here?

-- I could ask you the same.

He has a point.

-- I was just leaving.

You pick up your things that you had set down at your cubicle (luckily) and walk
across the floor to the exit door.

The entire car ride home, you construct a plan to continue your investigation.
This time, you had to be more aggressive. You couldn't be looking for backdoors
anymore. Anything with a backdoor wouldn't be important enough. Otherwise, it
would be made more secure.

After a well deserved nap and a meal, you hop on your computer.

You recall a set of binaries Kelly sent you about a month ago that you never got
around to cracking. They were difficult. They didn't seem to have a backdoor,
but that was before you began playing around with Angr. It is time to revisit
them.
