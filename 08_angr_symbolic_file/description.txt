Tuesday afternoon. Jeff is out sick.

A notification pops up on your screen. An email. From Jeff.

- Hey,
- 
- I was just thinking. Remember how I told you a while back that
- simuvex.s_state.SimState.posix.dumps(0) would solve for any user input? I told
- you back then that I wasn't really sure how it worked. Well, I figured out how
- it works. On Unix based systems, stdin (which happens to be represented with
- the number 0) is a file, just like any other file your hard drive might store,
- or a file that you would use to read from the network.
-
- I found that you can use Angr to simulate files symbolically. This is great, be-
- cause it means you can inject symbols for many different types of communication,
- including reading a file from a hard drive, reading from the network, reading
- from stdin, or another communication stream.
-
- Just wanted to let you know!
- Jeff

Isn't he sick? Why is he working?

In any case, another email pops up, from Kelly.

- Hello,
-
- We got access to another binary from Eve Elle Software. Could you try to solve
- it? I had Jeff take a look at it. He told me that he wasn't feeling well, but that
- you would be an excellent person to ask. He said to look for the 'fopen' call
- to determine the filename, and that from there, you would know what to do.
-
- I'm still having to deal with the security breach from the other day. Let me
- know if you happen to see anything.
-
- Thanks,
- Kelly

Huh.
