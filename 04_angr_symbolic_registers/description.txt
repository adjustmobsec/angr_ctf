Scrawled on a sticky note, the words "URGENT, SEE ME IN MY OFFICE. -Kelly" had
been plastered to your monitor.

You had just arrived fifteen minutes late, due to unusually bad traffic. Perhaps
everyone had woken up late and scrambled to get to work, all at the same time.
It was Monday, after all. The worst day of the week.

You grab the sticky note and crumple it up as you walk. You toss it in the
trash can at the entrance to her office.

-- Hey. Beautiful day!

-- You're fifteen minutes late.

Kelly is clearly not in the mood for small talk.

-- Sorry about that, the traffic--

-- Never mind that. Eve Elle Software is about to release a new version of their
   software today. To the public.

-- Great! We have passwords to the backdoor. We can--

-- See, that's why I called you in here. They won't work.

-- But I thought you said they were perfect. We found the backdoor, and they
   have no idea.

-- That's what I thought, too. But yesterday evening, I got information that
   they changed the locks again. I tried calling you, but you didn't answer.

You had set up an app on your phone that blocks calls from her after work hours,
but you don't mention that.

She continues.

-- According to my source, they figured out that we have the passwords. My sour-
   ce said something else about how they know that you're angry. If there's
   something you need to tell me about that, you should know that you can always
   talk to me about it.

You stare blankly.

-- Back to the issue at hand. My source informed me that the new security
   they use to defend their backdoor. Take a look at this, it's from my source.

She shows you part of an email, with some text highlighted.

- The new binary asks the user to input three hexadecimal numbers. Each of these
- numbers is then encrypted with a complex function. I'm pretty sure Angr cannot
- handle the way the binary inputs the three numbers. You'll have to do it man-
- ually. After the binary inputs the numbers, it places them in three different
- registers, though I'm not sure which ones.

The email continues with links to various pieces of documentation.

Kelly mutters to herself.

-- I wonder why she keeps misspelling anger...

-- Can you forward that to me, Kelly?

-- Sure can. Oh, and before you go--try not to get angry. It's only code, after
   all, isn't it?

She smiles.

You get back to your desk to find the forwarded email waiting for you. You open
it up, and click on the documentation, to find a list of functions with some
comments about each one.

This would be perfect, but Kelly hasn't sent the binaries yet.

Just at that moment, you receive an email from Kelly with an awfully convenient
attachment... Perfect timing.
