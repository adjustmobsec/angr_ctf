-- Hey, could you do me a quick favor?

-- Uh. Depends on what it is, Jeff. It's almost 5pm on a Friday. I want to go
   home and relax for the weekend.

-- It'll be quick, I promise.

-- Alright, what is it?

-- I need you to crack a few binaries, find a backdoor.

-- I don't know... That sounds like it'll take a while. I'm off the clock in
   four minutes. Can it wait until Monday?

-- Look, I helped you solve all of those binaries for Kelly--

-- I know Jeff, thank you so much for that, I really appreciate it, but you're
   just a fellow intern. I'd have to do it on my own time, I wouldn't get paid
   for it. On top of this job, I'm trying to finish a degree, and honestly, I
   want my time at home to relax and watch TV so--

-- Look, please? I'll repay the favor. I promise. It'll just take a little
   while.

-- Fine, I'll take a look.

-- Thank you. Check your inbox.

Seconds later, you feel your pocket vibrate.

- Hey,
-
- Again, thank you.
-
- The binary is fairly simple. It prompts the user for input with:
- scanf("%u %8s", ...);
- and then places the integer and the string on the stack. With the right input,
- it opens the backdoor.
