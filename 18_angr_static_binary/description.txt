-- Hey, can I pull you aside?

-- What do you want, Jeff?

-- I know what's going on, and I can explain.

-- You're ruining my career, what more could you possibly want from me?

-- Look, I know you snooped through my computer. I know you gained access to the
   Eve Elle server. I can get you out of this mess, but I need you to trust me. 
   I promise this is the last time I'll ever ask anything of you. This one last
   thing, and I'll clear your record with Kelly. And if you feel like you can
   no longer do that, I'll find you a job--a real job, not an internship--else-
   where.

-- I can't trust you, you know that. I'm going to get back to work.

-- Just one thing. I promise. It'll be simple. I'm trying to help you.

-- What is it?

-- I need you to crack a binary for me.

You begin to lose your calm.

-- You want me to crack a binary?

   And get in more trouble than I already am in? What the hell do you want? Me
   fired?--

-- I just need you to--

-- No! I will do nothing for you. I owe you nothing. Get out of my cubicle, and
   leave. You want to help me? Leave this office. Quit, and never come back, as
   long as I'm around.

At that moment, Kelly walks over, smiles at Jeff, and then turns to you, drop-
ping her smile.

-- Check your email. And get back to work.

You do just that.

- Binaries attached. 
- Kelly

Not even her usual friendly 'hello.'

Each file is large. The libraries have been linked statically. This might cause
some problems.

Jeff walks back over.

-- Let me help you with that.

-- Get the hell out of my cubicle.

-- No, let me help you. I'll send you an email.

Fine, might as well look.

- Hey,
-
- These binaries have been linked statically. You're going to have some problems
- with Angr because of that, but they are easy to get around. You will want to
- bind any complex function you use to the corresponding pre-written
- SimProcedure included with Angr. Take a look at the GitHub repository to see
- which of them are implemented. You can access them either by referencing the
- class directly, or with a dict they provide. For example, libc's 'rand' func-
- tion can be accessed with the following code:
- simuvex.SimProcedures['libc.so.6']['rand']
- 
- Also, you might need to add the add_options={"BYPASS_UNSUPPORTED_SYSCALL"}
- parameter to the factory function that initializes the initial SimState. It
- tells Angr to ignore any syscall it doesn't recognize. In some cases, this can
- cause weird behavior, but if there are syscalls that don't have any effect on
- the part of the program you are trying to analyze, you can safely bypass them
- to avoid errors.
-
- Also, we should talk tomorrow. Meet me for coffee at 9am at the bakery down
- the street?
-
- Jeff
