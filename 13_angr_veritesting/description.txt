It's Monday.

You have to go to work.

When you arrive, Kelly glares at you. 

On your way to your cubicle, you walk by Jeff. You do not make eye contact. As
you pass him, he leans towards you, as if to say something, but you speed up.
Momentarily, he turns back to glance at you, but then decides otherwise, and
continues walking to the coffee machine.

*Buzz* *Buzz*

You have an email notification on your phone. You pull out your computer and
look at it.

- Hello,
-
- I attached a few binaries for you to solve. Thanks.
-
- Kelly
- Security Team Manager
- Skynet Software

No description. No reason why they need to be solved. No information at all. You
glance at the binaries and they look fairly simple. You figure it's probably Kel-
ly's way of keeping you busy while she figures out what to do you with you. You
write a quick Angr script to solve the challenge. It's the same as the first one
you ever wrote, with the addresses changed slightly. It should solve the problem
after a bit of time.

Five minutes later, it's still running.

Jeff walks by.

-- That's not going to work.

-- What?

-- Your Angr script, on that binary.

-- How do you know about--?

-- I wrote it for her. She wanted something for you to do.

-- Look--

-- Try Veritesting.

-- What?

-- Veritesting. Enable it. When you construct your path group, set the veri-
   testing parameter to true.

He walks away.

You watch him as he walks away. You should be angry. You should be yelling at
him for potentially ruining your career. But right now, you're just tired.

You Google veritesting. The search result doesn't come up with a whole lot, only
this link:
