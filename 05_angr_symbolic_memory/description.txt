When you arrive at work on Monday, the office appears to be in a frantic hurry,
despite being only 8am. You've never witnessed this before in your entire four
months at the company. Normally, at this hour, everyone is quiet, minding their
own sleep-deprived business. By nine or so, after everyone has arrived and man-
aged to stumble over the coffee machine, the office tends to wake up. But today,
something is wrong.

-- Hey.

-- Hey Jeff, how was your weekend?

-- Good. Uh... Hey, thanks for solving those binaries for me.

-- No problem.

-- Uh... I have another few that need to be solved, would you mind working thr-
   ough them?

You hesitate. You don't really want to do anything else for Jeff. He isn't your
manager. You aren't really supposed to be working for him anyway. But, on the
other hand, you don't want to involve yourself in whatever is happening around
you.

-- Yeah, sure. Send them over.

As anticipated, the email comes within seconds.

- Hey,
-
- These binaries should be pretty similar to the last few. I've identified that
- at some point, the program calls 'scanf("%8s %8s %8s %8s", ...)', but that's
- all I know.
- 
- Jeff
