According to your phone, it's 9:11am.

Jeff is now eleven minutes late. You are starting to regret agreeing to meet him
here.

At that moment, he and a woman you do not recognize walk through the door. You
feel worse than when he wasn't here. Both he and the woman are dressed in formal
business attire; no one at the Skynet office would have worn any clothes even
remotely close to as formal as they looked. T-shirt and non-gym shorts would
serve as perfectly acceptable clothes for a summer day such as today.

They walked over sat down next to you, motioning to the barista. He nodded back
and began preparing two drinks.

They come here often.

-- Hello, I'm Claire, from Eve Elle Software.

She stuck out her hand. You hesitate before shaking it. She continues talking.

-- We are here in order to offer you a job.

-- I don't understand. I didn't apply there... I can't think of anyone works
   there.

-- Except me.

Jeff smiles at you in a conceited 'I know more than you' kind of way. Claire
continues.

-- We are very impressed with your ability to find the backdoors and exploit bi-
   naries. You have been of great help to us. We would like to continue a rel-
   ationship with you, and compensate you for your services. We are offering you
   a job. A full-time, real job. Not an internship. Of course, we know you are
   pursuing a graduate degree, and will support you in whatever way we can while
   you complete it.

-- I've helped you?

-- Of course. You have been finding the backdoors in the software. This helps us
   build more sophisticated backdoors. In fact, recently, you have convinced us
   that including a backdoor in software at all is a poor idea. It's insecure,
   allowing attackers such as yourself to break in.

   Jeff tells me that you will not likely be hired by Skynet when your intern-
   ship concludes. Is that a fair judgement?

You remain silent.

-- Consider our offer. Check your personal email when you get home for the de-
tails.

-- How do you have my--?

-- Thank you for your time.

You continue to speak, but both Claire and Jeff stand up and walk towards the
door, clearly not listening to you.

When you arrive at work, the office is quiet except for the coffee machine,
grumbling away in the break room.

Kelly walks over.

-- Check your email, I have a few more binaries for you to look at.

She has a slight smirk as she says this. More busywork. She still doesn't trust
you. Surely, she is waiting for the day you either leave, or her supervisors
grant her permission to let you go.

-- Actually, I don't think I will.

-- Excuse me?

-- I quit.

She opens her mouth, as if to yell, but then closes it and smiles before speak-
ing.

-- Of course. I'll see that you get your final paycheck as soon as possible.

...

When you arrive home, two emails are waiting. One from Claire and the second
from Jeff.

The first one:

- Hello,
-
- We are glad your are considering our offer. We can give you a salary above the
- market standard, which can be discussed once you perform the following step:
-
- If you would like to join as an employee, please run the attached binary with
- the activation code below.
-
- Employee activation code: aQz99ckL
-
- Best regards,
- Claire Liu
- Hiring Manager
- Eve Elle Software

The second:

- Hey,
-
- The server that generates the employee activation codes has been having some
- problems lately. It might give you an incorrect code. If so, you know what to
- do.
-
- A few pieces of information related to Angr that I learned about today:
-
- There are quite a few types of binaries Angr supports, not just executables.
- You can load shared libraries in the same way you would load an executable,
- you will just need to specify the address at which to start executing.
-
- One interesting way to specify an entry state is with the
- project.factory.call_state(address, *bitvector_params)
- function. This will initialize the starting state as if the computer called
- that function with the parameters you specify. If you want to specify an ad-
- dress to jump to after the function returns, use the named ret_addr parameter.
-
- Additionally, watch out for the fact that shared libraries typically use pos-
- ition-independent code, meaning that the addresses specified in the binary
- will actually be an offset from some other position when loaded in to an exe-
- cutable. In order to deal with this when the library is not being loaded by
- an executable (because we are loading it directly with Angr,) we have to spec-
- ify a base address when creating the project.
-
- Thought I should let you know!
- Jeff
