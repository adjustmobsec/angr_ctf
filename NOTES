why is check_all_Z not the password?
 - figure out what is causing the explosion,

call complex function on password in level 8 in description (scaffold)

- add gcc-32 to requirements
- document package.py to explain how it works
- add something that uses unicorn engine
- redo or remove 07, pushing anything to the heap probably doesn't need to be taught
  perhaps rename to "use_memory" or something to teach that you can use arbitrary
  memory addresses

slideshow -> hooks -> change 16 bytes to 19 (double check this)

Replace read/write levels with angr.Project.inspect (see documentation)
  can hook all memory reads/writes!!!
  instead of replace, add new levels that use these

add checks to ensure everything is printed nicely (trailing \0)
for all arbitrary x, ensure solutions are capital letters

for 17, add an exit() after print good job
