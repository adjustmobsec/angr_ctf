Wait a second. The public IP of the Jeff's development server is part of a well-
known subnet owned by Eve Elle Software. Everything is beginning to click tog-
ether.

It's late at night by now. You hear the occasional siren of police performing
their duty at the most dangerous time of their collective daily routine.

You know how to access the production server that should be running the produc-
tion ready version of the software you just found an exploit for.

You hold your breadth as you type in the password.

It works. After all, the backdoor is intended to provide access for certain mem-
bers of their company. Just not you.

The Linux user under which the program you exploited doesn't have access to many
interesting files. You do, however, come across a read-only version of a binary
that appears to run one of the companies primary services. It would certainly be
run under an account with more interesting information.

This time, you look at the binary yourself. You find that the code appears to be
calling scanf in a loop, reading in two integers at a time for a total of eight
unsigned integers. You can't skip this scanf, as the comparison that checks if a
password is valid appears to run alongside the scanf in the loop. After some rea-
search, you find that you may need to use 'hooks', functionality in Angr that
tells the symbolic execution engine to halt, run some of your own code, and then
continue when it hits a certain address.
